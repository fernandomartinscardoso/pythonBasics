# 100 Days of Python Coding

Based on the course __100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp__ by Dr. Angela Yu, available at [Udemy Platform](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

## Day 1

How to use basic output (`print()`) and input commands, declare variables and concatenate strings. Final day project:

```python
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator!")
user_city = input("What is the name of the city where you grew up in?\n")
user_pet = input("What is your pet's name?\n")
print("Your band name could be " + user_city + " " + user_pet)

```
